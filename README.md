# Hand-Gesture-Based-Screen-Brightness-Control-using-OpenCV
This project provides a computer vision solution to control screen brightness using hand gestures with Python and OpenCV. Using Mediapipe's hand detection model, it captures real-time hand movements via webcam and adjusts brightness based on the distance between hand landmarks, like the thumb and index finger, hands-free control.
