# Hand Gesture-Based Screen Brightness Control using OpenCV

This project provides a computer vision solution to control screen brightness using hand gestures with Python and OpenCV. By leveraging Mediapipe's hand detection model, it captures real-time hand movements via a webcam and adjusts brightness based on the distance between hand landmarks, such as the thumb and index finger. The project can be extended for gesture-based controls in other applications, offering an intuitive, hands-free interaction model.

## Features
- Real-time hand gesture detection using Mediapipe
- Dynamic adjustment of screen brightness based on hand landmark positions
- Easy integration and deployment with minimal dependencies

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- Numpy

To install the dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
